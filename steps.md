To set up the **build and release pipeline** for a **Python TOML project** using **GitHub Actions**, with **Poetry** for dependency management, and **Docker** for packaging, and to **handle tagging** based on the type of changes (e.g., Bug, Feature, Refactor, Release, Documentation), we'll structure the workflow as follows:

### Key Requirements:
1. **Run pre-commit hooks** to ensure code quality.
2. **Use Poetry** for managing dependencies and setting up the environment.
3. **Build a Docker image** for the Python project.
4. **Handle versioning/tags** when merging pull requests based on the type of changes:
   - **Bug**: `bugfix-<issue-number>`
   - **Feature**: `feature-<feature-name>`
   - **Refactor**: `refactor-<refactor-description>`
   - **Release**: `release-<version>`
   - **Documentation**: `docs-<documentation-summary>`

This will require setting up multiple jobs in GitHub Actions, including:
1. **Pre-commit hooks** for code quality.
2. **Docker image building** for packaging.
3. **Tagging mechanism** based on PR labels or commit messages.

### 1. **Prepare Pre-commit and Poetry Configuration**

#### `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (for code quality checks)
```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-flake8
  rev: v3.9.2  # Version of flake8
  hooks:
    - id: flake8
      args: ["--max-line-length=88"]

- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-black
  rev: v21.10b0  # Version of black
  hooks:
    - id: black
      args: ["--check"]

- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
  rev: v0.910
  hooks:
    - id: mypy
      args: ["--config-file", "mypy.ini"]
```

Install the pre-commit hook configuration in your repository:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

#### `pyproject.toml` (Poetry and dependencies)
```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "your-python-project"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A Python project"
authors = ["Your Name <youremail@example.com>"]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.9"
requests = "^2.25.1"  # Example of a dependency

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
pre-commit = "^2.13.0"
flake8 = "^3.9.2"
black = "^21.10b0"
mypy = "^0.910"
```

### 2. **GitHub Actions Workflow:**

Here’s the **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`build-and-release.yml`) that includes:
- **Pre-commit hook execution** to ensure code quality.
- **Docker image building**.
- **Tagging the release** based on pull request labels or commit message.

#### `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml`

```yaml
name: Build and Release Python Docker Image

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
    types: [opened, synchronize, closed]  # Trigger on PR creation, updates, and closure

  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Triggered on pushing to the main branch

          # Check for PR labels to decide on tag
          PR_LABELS=$(jq -r '.pull_request.labels[].name' <<< "${{ github.event }}")

          # Default tag prefix
          TAG_PREFIX="dev"

          # Determine tag based on label
          if echo "$PR_LABELS" | grep -q "Bug"; then
            TAG_PREFIX="bugfix"
          elif echo "$PR_LABELS" | grep -q "Feature"; then

          git push origin ${{ env.VERSION_TAG }}
```

### Explanation of Workflow:

#### 1. **Pre-commit Job:**
- **Install Poetry**: Installs **Poetry** for dependency management.
- **Install Dependencies**: Installs project dependencies using **Poetry**.
- **Install and Run Pre-commit Hooks**: Installs **pre-commit** hooks and runs them on all files to ensure code quality (e.g., `flake8`, `black`, `mypy`).

#### 2. **Build Job:**
- **Set up Docker Buildx**: Configures **Docker Buildx** for building Docker images.
- **Log in to Docker**: Logs into **Docker Hub** using stored GitHub secrets (`DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`).
- **Build Docker Image**: Builds and tags the Docker image with both `latest` and the commit SHA.
- **Push Docker Image**: Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub.

#### 3. **Release Job:**
- **Determine PR Type and Create Tag**: 
  - Checks the **PR labels** to determine the type of change (e.g., Bug, Feature, Refactor, Release, Documentation).
  - Based on the label, generates a **tag** like `bugfix-<timestamp>`, `feature-<timestamp>`, etc.
- **Push the Tag**: Pushes the generated tag back to the GitHub repository.

### 3. **Dockerfile**

Make sure to have a proper `Dockerfile` to package your Python app. Here’s a simple example:

```Dockerfile
# Use a base Python image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Install Poetry
RUN curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
ENV PATH="$HOME/.poetry/bin:$PATH"

# Copy the pyproject.toml and poetry.lock files
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock /app/

# Install dependencies
RUN poetry install --no-dev --no-interaction

# Copy the rest of the application
COPY . .

# Expose the application port (optional)
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the application (adjust according to your project)
CMD ["poetry", "run", "python", "app.py"]
```

### 4. **Docker Credentials Management (GitHub Secrets)**

Ensure your Docker credentials are safely stored in GitHub Secrets:
1. Go to **Settings > Secrets** in your repository.
2. Add `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`.

### Conclusion:

With this workflow, you'll have:
- Pre-commit hooks to check code quality.
- **Poetry** to manage dependencies and environment setup.
- Docker-based packaging and image pushing.
- Dynamic tagging based on the PR label (Bug, Feature, Refactor, Release, Documentation).

This ensures that your development process remains efficient, automated, and organized.
